- **On-Time Delivery (OTD):** 31%  
- **Late Delivery Rate:** 68.65%  
- **Average Late Days:** 2  
- **Average Shipping Cost:** $11  

### Late Delivery by Time
- November: 62.7% late  
- December: 70.3% late

**Insights:**
- Late delivery is systemic, not just peak-week failures  
- Capacity constraints persist beyond peak holiday weeks  

### Delivery Status Mix
- ~31K late deliveries vs ~14K on time  
- Late deliveries dominate — structural fulfillment issue  

### Carrier Performance
- UPS, DHL, FedEx, USPS all show high late rates  
- DHL highest 7-day late deliveries  
- No single-carrier solution; diversification insufficient  

### Warehouse Performance
- High late delivery in W02, W03, W05 (~20% each)  
- Performance variance indicates process/capacity gaps  

### Service Level Analysis
- **Expedited:** Highest OTD (47%) but below expectations  
- **BOPIS & Overnight:** OTD ~32–34% with 2-day delays  
- **Standard:** OTD 24%, worst average lateness  

**Business Impact**
- Late deliveries → customer dissatisfaction, refunds, support costs  
- Undermines campaign profitability  

**Strategic Recommendations**
1. Reset delivery promises aligned with capacity  
2. Shift volume to controllable channels (BOPIS, in-store)  
3. Fix fulfillment bottlenecks in underperforming warehouses  
4. Enforce carrier accountability via SLA-linked contracts  
5. Protect premium margins when OTD drops below threshold  
6. Gate holiday campaigns with logistics sign-off

### Executive KPIs
- **Total Quantity Sold:** 328K units  
- **Total Revenue:** $44.84M  
- **Total Profit:** $11.3M  
- **COGS:** $34M

- **Winter-specific:** Moderate spike, lower upside  

**Cross-Category Insight**
- High-performing categories: giftable, high-margin, predictable  
- Long-tail SKUs add complexity with low profit return  

### Top Product by Revenue Within Each Category
- Single hero SKU per category generates $10K–$12K+ profit

6. Guarantee omnichannel availability of top SKUs  
7. Shift promotions from discount-led to product-led  
8. Use seasonality tags as a planning lever  
9. Align inventory depth with profitability, not revenue  
10. Create a repeatable holiday playbook
